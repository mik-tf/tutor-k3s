## Open edX Components

Open edX consists of several core components, each with different resource requirements:

- **LMS (Learning Management System)**: Main platform students interact with
- **Studio (CMS)**: Content management system for course creators
- **Forums**: Discussion platform
- **MFE (Micro Frontend)**: Modern front-end applications
- **Database (MySQL)**: Primary data storage
- **MongoDB**: Used for course content, forums, etc.
- **Redis**: Caching and session management
- **Elasticsearch**: Search functionality
- **Celery workers**: Background task processing

## Hardware Requirements

### Blueprint Configurations By Deployment Size

Below are the optimal hardware configurations for Open edX deployments of different sizes, based on industry standards and real-world implementations as of 2025.

### Testing/Development Environment (25-50 Students)

```
Control plane nodes (1):
- CPU: 4 vCores
- Memory: 8 GB (minimum 4GB) 
- Disk: 100 GB SSD

Worker nodes (2):
- CPU: 8 vCores (minimum 4 vCores)
- Memory: 16 GB (minimum 8GB per node)
- Disk: 250 GB SSD
```

**Absolute Minimum (not recommended for production):**
- 1 control node: 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM
- 2 worker nodes: 4 vCPU, 8GB RAM each

## Capacity Planning

### Student Load Factors

When planning capacity, consider:

1. **Concurrent active users**: This is more important than total enrolled students. Typically, 10-20% of enrolled students are active concurrently during peak periods.

2. **Course types**:
   - Text-based courses: Lower resource requirements
   - Video-heavy courses: Higher bandwidth and storage needs
   - Interactive assessments: Higher CPU needs
   - Lab environments: Specialized resource requirements

3. **Usage patterns**:
   - Regular coursework: Predictable resource needs
   - Exam periods: High, concentrated demand
   - Project deadlines: Spikes in submissions and grading

### Capacity Guidelines

| Total Enrolled Students | Concurrent Users (Peak) | Recommended Configuration |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| 100-500 | 25-75 | Minimum (3 control + 3 workers) |
| 500-1,000 | 75-150 | Standard (3 control + 3-5 workers) |
| 1,000-5,000 | 150-750 | Production (3 control + 5-7 workers) |
| 5,000-10,000 | 750-1,500 | Large Scale (3-5 control + 8-12 workers) |
| 10,000+ | 1,500+ | Enterprise (5 control + 15+ workers with auto-scaling) |

## Kubernetes Cluster Configurations

### Control Plane Best Practices

1. **Number of nodes**:
   - **Minimum**: 1 node (development only)
   - **Recommended**: 3 nodes (production)
   - **Enterprise**: 5 nodes (large-scale deployments)

2. **Etcd considerations**:
   - Dedicated etcd nodes for very large clusters
   - SSD storage for etcd performance
   - Sufficient memory (8GB+) for cluster state

3. **High availability**:
   - Distribute across availability zones
   - Load balancer for API server
   - Automated backups for etcd

### Worker Node Best Practices

1. **Node pools by function**:
   - General-purpose nodes for most services
   - Memory-optimized nodes for databases and cache
   - Compute-optimized nodes for analytics and batch processing

2. **Affinity and anti-affinity rules**:
   - Keep related services together
   - Distribute critical services across nodes
   - Separate database instances from heavy compute workloads

3. **Resource allocation**:
   - Set appropriate requests and limits
   - Avoid over-provisioning
   - Allow headroom for spikes (70-80% target utilization)

### Storage Configurations

1. **Database storage**:
   - High-performance SSD for MySQL and MongoDB
   - Regular backups with point-in-time recovery
   - Consider managed database services for production

2. **Object storage**:
   - External S3-compatible storage for course content and user uploads
   - Caching layer for frequently accessed content
   - Regional data residency compliance where needed

3. **Persistent volumes**:
   - Local path provisioner for development
   - Cloud provider storage classes for production
   - StorageClass configuration with appropriate reclaim policy

## Monitoring and Scaling Recommendations

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **System-level metrics**:
   - CPU utilization (target: <80%)
   - Memory utilization (target: <80%)
   - Disk I/O (watch for bottlenecks)
   - Network throughput

2. **Application metrics**:
   - Response times (target: <2s)
   - Error rates (target: <1%)
   - Queue depths for Celery
   - Database query performance

3. **User experience metrics**:
   - Page load times
   - Video buffering rates
   - Submission success rates
   - Login success/failure

### Scaling Triggers

1. **Horizontal scaling** (when to add nodes):
   - Sustained CPU/memory above 70% across cluster
   - Consistent response time degradation
   - Queue backlog growth

2. **Vertical scaling** (when to upgrade nodes):
   - Specific resource bottlenecks (e.g., memory pressure)
   - Database performance issues
   - Resource limits frequently reached

### Recommended Monitoring Stack

1. **Prometheus** for metrics collection
2. **Grafana** for visualization and alerting
3. **Loki** for log aggregation
4. **Jaeger** for distributed tracing

## Conclusion

Proper resource allocation and capacity planning are essential for a successful Open edX deployment on Kubernetes. Start with the recommended configurations for your expected user base and implement a robust monitoring system to identify scaling needs proactively. Regular performance testing, especially before high-usage periods like course launches or exams, will help ensure a smooth experience for all users.

For optimal performance with your Mathematics, Physics, and Metaphysics educational platform, we highly recommend adhering to the specified hardware requirements above. For the early testing phase, the minimum testing configuration will support approximately 25-50 concurrent active students. As your program grows, upgrading to the small or medium production configurations would allow for a more reliable experience supporting 100-500 concurrent users, which typically corresponds to a total enrollment of 500-2500 students, assuming typical attendance and usage patterns.
